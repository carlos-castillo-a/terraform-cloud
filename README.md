# Integration with Terraform Cloud
This repository will hold the contents of .tf configuration files for projects built on AWS, Azure, and GCP. It will also reference modules used to test the standardization of various types of common resources. The ultimate goal is to automate deployments by integrating Version Control with Terraform Cloud.

### Workflow
The projects in this repository are created by Terraform Cloud using Remote runs as shown in this diagram:
